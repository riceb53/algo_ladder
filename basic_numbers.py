# Write a function that prints out every number from 1 to N, with the following exceptions:

# Write a function that gives the Nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the sequence goes like this:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on until infinity...

# Input: 9
# Output: 21 (as this is the 9th number of the Fibonacci Sequence)

# Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

# The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1

# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

# def collatz(n):
#     i = 0
#     while True:
#         if n == 1:
#             return i
#         if n % 2 == 0:
#             n /= 2
#         else:
#             n = (3 * n) + 1
#         i += 1


# print(collatz(12) == 9)

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
